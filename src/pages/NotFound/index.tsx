          <p>
            Oops! It looks like the page you're trying to access doesn't exist.
            Maybe it went on vacation, decided to explore the universe, or got
            lost somewhere between two black holes. 🌌
          </p>
          <p>
            But don't worry, you're not lost in space (yet). You can safely
            return to the <RouterLink href="/">home page</RouterLink> or{" "}
            <RouterLink href="/history">the history</RouterLink> — or you can
            stay here and pretend you found a secret page that only the coolest
            explorers can access. 🧭✨
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think this page should exist (or if you want to chat about
            time travel and wormholes), just get in touch. Otherwise, use the
            menu to return to the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, here's something to ponder: "If a page doesn't
            exist on the internet, did it ever really exist?" 🤔💭
